 What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing means using computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet instead of your own physical computer or data center.
Simple words: You rent IT resources from cloud providers and use them when needed.
Example:
Gmail → You don’t install mail servers
Google Drive → You don’t buy hard disks

**Popular cloud providers:**
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Microsoft Azure
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
